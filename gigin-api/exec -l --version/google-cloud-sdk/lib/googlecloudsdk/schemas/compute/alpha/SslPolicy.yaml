  minTlsVersion:
    description: |-
      The minimum version of SSL protocol that can be used by the clients to
      establish a connection with the load balancer. This can be one
      ofTLS_1_0, TLS_1_1, TLS_1_2,TLS_1_3. When set to TLS_1_3, the profile
      field must be set to RESTRICTED.

  postQuantumKeyExchange:

      One of DEFAULT, ENABLED, or DEFERRED. Controls whether the load
      balancer allows negotiating X25519MLKEM768 key exchange when clients
      advertise support for it. When set to DEFAULT, or if no SSL Policy is
      attached to the target proxy, the load balancer disallows
      X25519MLKEM768 key exchange until it is enabled by default on load balancers.
      When set to ENABLED, the load balancer can negotiate X25519MLKEM768
      key exchange. When set to DEFERRED, temporarily opts out the load
      balancer from negotiating X25519MLKEM768 beyond the point where it is
      enabled by default on load balancers.

      of SSL features to enable must be specified in the customFeatures
